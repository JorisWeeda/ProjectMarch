This document is a log for inserting the inertia estimator into the model predictive controller

Aparently the date and time can only be inputted by going to a submenu. The f5 command does not work.

These variables should exist in the MPC file, since the values are written to it:

Rotational estimator:
samples_
lambda[0]
alpha_filter_size[0]
vibration_boundaries[0]

Translational estimator:
lambda[1]
alpha_filter_size[1]
vibration_boundaries[1]

All of these variables are introduced in the lines above: 66-69

line 83:     inertia_estimators_.resize(num_joints_);

inertia_estimators_ is a vector of instances of the InertiaEstimator class. However, it seems like the vector is initilized without a size and is therefore GIVEN a size with the '.resize(num_joints_)' command

Vectors are the code elements from C++ most like lists. They are bassicly containers that can change in size. And apparently they can be initialized without a size.

Line 84-92:
This is a loop to create a inertia estimator for each joint and assign these inertia estimators either the parameters for a rotating or translating joint according to the pattern 00110011 where 0=rotating 1=translating
